# Git Commands to Push Your Changes

Run these commands to push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Stage all files except those in .gitignore
git add .

# Verify what will be committed
git status

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Updated app with fixes for splash screen and Firebase auth"

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push origin master
```

## Important Notes Before Pushing:

1. Make sure your `.gitignore` file is correctly set up (already done)

2. These files should NOT be pushed to GitHub:

   - `google-services.json` (Firebase configuration)
   - `serviceAccountKey.json` (Firebase Admin SDK credentials)
   - Any `.env` files with API keys or secrets
   - Any `.jks` keystore files for app signing

3. After pushing, verify on GitHub that no sensitive files were uploaded.

4. If you accidentally push sensitive data, immediately:
   - Change any exposed credentials
   - Create a new commit removing the sensitive data
   - Consider using BFG Repo-Cleaner or git-filter-branch to remove the data from history

## What Will Be Pushed:

- App code and configuration files
- Documentation files you've created
- Asset files (images, animations)
- Configuration files (without sensitive data)
