## üß± Build & Deployment

### Expo Application Services (EAS)

```bash
# Android
eas build -p android --profile development

eas build -p android --profile preview

eas build -p android --profile production

## üîê Firebase Configuration Checklist

- Enable **Email/Password** and (optional) Social providers in Firebase Authentication
- Create Firestore collections: `users`, `BloodDonors`, `Bloodreceiver`, and supporting analytics collections
- Configure Firestore security rules to enforce role-based access (`isAdmin`, `isDonor`, etc.)
- Set up Cloud Messaging for donor/receiver notification delivery
- (Optional) Deploy Cloud Functions for scheduled tasks and notification fan-out

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin & Security Notes

- Default admin credentials should be rotated before production launches
- Bootstrap values are injected via `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; remove or rotate them after provisioning the first admin
- Sensitive artifacts (`.env`, `google-services.json`, `serviceAccountKey.json`, keystore files) **must not** be committed
- Refer to `SECURITY.md` for guidance on hardening Firebase rules and rotating keys
- Matched pairs management and user suspension flows are surfaced under the Admin navigation stack
